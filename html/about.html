        <h1>Kevin Lam</h1>
        <p>
          I am currently a senior at Lehigh University studying Computer
          Engineering. I am from Garland, Texas, and am currently looking for a
          full-time role anywhere in the U.S. I am interested in software,
          hardware, and systems engineering roles, but am open to exploring
          other options as well. I am passionate about all things technology as
          well as the integration of computer hardware and software. I have
          experience in electrical engineering at my past internship at Wavemode
          LLC and am currently a systems engineering intern at Collins
          Aerospace.
